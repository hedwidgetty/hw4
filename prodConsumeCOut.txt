//Each producer and each consumer has it's own thread, so each pair makes/consumes 5 widgets.  However, the joins on the later threads are not necessary because it is all executed from the first producer/consumer pair.

//D) It definitely makes a difference if there are more consumers than producers - the final consumer ends up waiting forever and never terminates.  If there are more producers than consumers, the final producer goes to sleep waiting for its widgets to be consumed, and never wakes up to terminate.

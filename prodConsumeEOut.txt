//No, it would never get to the other producers/consumers, unless you made 5 buffers.  This seems to be producing all 10, then consuming and going back and forth, taking turns, so this would go on forever and the other threads would never get their turn.  But when I ran it, sometimes it would say Producer waiting twice in a row, so maybe it was changing out between which producer was producing and which consumer was consuming.  But the other joins would never be executed.
